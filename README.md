## Running

In order to get "Movies" running all you have to do is clone this in your local computer and open the solution. As long as you have Xamarin installed it will run.

## Structure
 
There is an Android, iOS and PCL solution.

Most of the work was done in the PCL solution because this project is renderer-free just like I promised. Although I would like to point out that in order to have a working splash screen in Android I had to do some work in the local Android project itself but that didn't have anything to do with renderers which is awesome too! If you are curious about how I did it no worries! I will post a tutorial on [Intern Life](https://www.intern.life/) on how I did it.
 
## Contributing

No rules on how to contribute because at the end of the day this is for learning purposes so feel free to contribute to the project as much as you want and ask for help whenever you feel stuck.
  
## Preview
  
This is what the app currently looks like. iOS on the left, Android on the right. ✌️
