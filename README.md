## Libraries

Here are the libraries used that made this great learning resource possible.

1) For loosely coupled code and easy MVVM navigation [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism)
2) For the bottom TabBar on Android: [BottomNavigationBarXF](https://github.com/thrive-now/BottomNavigationBarXF)
3) For the circled images: [ImageCircle](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/ImageCirclePlugin)
4) For great performance when loading images: [FFImageLoading](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading)
5) For cool INotifyPropertyChanged implementation: [Fody/PropertyChanged](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged)
6) For reading the local json file in the PCL solution: [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)

## Tutorials

I will cover the details of how it was done from the main entry point to the last bit of code running on my [personal blog](www.intern.life) so stay tuned! üï∫
